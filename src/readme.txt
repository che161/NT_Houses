This project is my second R project for dealing with one set of my research project data. The project investigates the overheating issue in about 28,000 new deisgned houses in Australia 
using different overheating criteria. The research is to find an appripriate overheating criteria for use in Australia.

All the data were generated by myself when I run a buildnig simulation software. 

Result2.txt contains information of for all real house designs in Australia which I have collected via a webportal managed by CSIRO. So, there are information of these real houses which are confidential.

Result2_error.txt and Result2_error2.txt contain information of those real house designs which cannot run through with the simulation due to various reasons.

Result2_Orig.csv and all otehr csv files contain the simulation results which are required for the analysis. However, they both include all the real house designs. So, I need to use the informatio in Result2_error.txt,Result2_error2.txt and Result2.txt to work out only those simulation results for houses which run with the simulation. 

The above processing is state by state. Then, results for all the states and terretories are combined in one csv file for further processing.
