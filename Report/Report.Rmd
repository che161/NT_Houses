# Introduction
I am a researcher with years of programming experiences in FORTRAN a computational programming language. Programming, computate simulations, research and communicating with various stakeholders and research partners in residential building energy efficiency are my daily activities. 

# My Project
Heat wave has been recognized as one of the major natural hazards which kill more people than any other natural hazards in Australia. Overheating in residential buildings is one of the major causes of heat related death during heat waves. This study investigates the potential overheating risks in the new housing stock across Australia using over 28,000 house designs during 2015 - 2018. Figure 1 shows the number of houses/apartment used in this study in each state and territory.

Simulations were carried out for all the houses in their local climates using AccuRate which is a house energy rating software developed by CSIRO. The indoor air temperatures in each living room and bedroom in the houses were recorded. The numebr of overheat hours were recorded when the indoor air temperarture in the living room or in the bedroom was higher than the threshholds defined by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) TM59. If the number of overheat hours in one living room or one bedroom aer above the CIBSE TM59 limits, the house/apartment is considered to fail the overheat criteria set by CIBSE TM59.

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

**Plots from R**
```{r standard-plot, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Yet another gapminder plot"}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1987) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Your figure and table captions are automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text
if needed: see eg. Table \@ref(tab:mytable) and Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot)

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Which ones have you learned since starting 
Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here.

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

What parts of the project took the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!
